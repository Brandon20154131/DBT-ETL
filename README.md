# 📦 DBT ETL (PostgreSQL + dbt)

### End-to-End Data Engineering | Medallion Architecture | ML-Ready Feature Store

This project implements a fully engineered **Medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)** using **PostgreSQL**, **dbt**, and **VS Code**, transforming multi-source CRM/ERP datasets into a clean analytics-ready and ML-ready dataset.

The pipeline loads raw CSVs, performs cleaning + validation, and produces a **final gold fact table** designed for machine learning tasks such as forecasting, segmentation, regression and customer behaviour modelling.

# 🧱 Architecture Overview

## 🥉 Bronze Layer — Raw Data
- Raw CSVs stored in `seeds/bronze/`
- Loaded into PostgreSQL using `dbt seed`
- Stored **exactly as received**
- Ensures reproducibility + acts as the system of record

## 🥈 Silver Layer — Cleaned & Conformed
- Cleaned models for:
  - `customers`
  - `products`
  - `sales_clean`
- Applies:
  - Data standardisation  
  - Missing value handling  
  - Type casting  
  - Date corrections  
  - Product hierarchy enrichment  
  - Customer gender/location standardisation  

## 🥇 Gold Layer — Machine Learning Feature Store
- A fully joined **fact_sales** table containing:
  - Customer attributes  
  - Product attributes  
  - Sales metrics  
  - Time features  
  - Behavioural metrics (recency, frequency, monetary value)  
- Optimised for:
  - Forecasting  
  - Clustering  
  - Segmentation  
  - Regression  
  - Classification  
  - Recommendation systems

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **PostgreSQL** | Database + medallion schemas |
| **dbt Core** | Transformations, orchestration, lineage & documentation |
| **VS Code** | Development |
| **pgAdmin** | SQL validation & monitoring |
| **Python** | ML experiments (outside dbt) |

# ⚙️ Pipeline Runbook

This project uses **multiple dbt targets** so each layer builds into its own schema:
## ✔ 1. Seed the Bronze layer

```bash
dbt seed -t bronze
